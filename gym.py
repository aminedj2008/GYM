            Creatine is a molecule thats produced naturally in your body. It provides energy for your muscles and other tissues.

However, taking it as a dietary supplement can increase muscle creatine content by up to 40 precen trusted Source beyond its normal levels.

This affects your muscle cells and exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount of researchTrusted Source shows creatine improves muscle strength.

This is good news if youre trying to gain muscle. Greater strength allows you to perform better during exercise, leading to larger increases in muscle mass over time.

Creatine can also increase water content in your muscle cells. This may cause your muscle cells to swell slightly and produce signals for muscle growth.

Furthermore, this supplement may increase levels of the hormones involved in muscle growth, such as IGF-1.

Moreover, some researchTrusted Source shows that creatine could decrease the breakdown of proteins in your muscles.

Overall, many researchers have studiedTrusted Source creatine supplements and exercise, and one thing is clear  creatine can help increase muscle mass.

Creatine has also been studied extensively and has an outstanding safety profile.

Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle.

Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural processes.

While it’s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people may struggle to do so.

If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a protein supplement.

There are many different protein supplements available, but some of the most popular are whey, casein, and soy protein. Other supplements contain protein isolated from eggs, split peas, rice, and hemp seeds.

ResearchTrusted Source shows that adding extra protein via supplements causes slightly more muscle gain in people who exercise than adding extra carbs.

However, the effects are probably largest for people who aren’t getting enough protein in their normal diet.

In fact, some researchTrusted Source shows that consuming very high amounts of protein supplements doesn’t help increase muscle if you are already following a high protein diet.

Many people wonder how much protein to eat daily. If you are an active individual trying to gain muscle, 0.6–0.9 grams (g) of protein per pound (lb.), or 1.4–2.0 g per kilogram (kg)Trusted Source, of body weight may be best.

Weight gainers are supplements designed to conveniently help you get more calories and protein. They’re typically used by individuals who struggle to gain muscle, even when consuming large amounts of calories and lifting weights.

Although the calorie contents of weight gainer supplements vary, it’s not uncommon for some to contain over 1,000 calories per serving.

Many people think these calories come from protein since it’s so important for muscle building. However, most of the calories actually come from carbs.

There are often 75–300 g of carbs, 20–60 g of protein, and 0–15 g of fat per serving in these high calorie supplements.

While these products can help you consume more calories, it’s important to realize that there is nothing magical about weight gainer supplements.

Some older researchTrusted Source in physically inactive adults has shown that drastically increasing calories can increase lean mass like muscle, as long as you eat enough protein.

However, researchTrusted Source in adults who weight trained indicated that consuming a weight gainer supplement may not be effective for increasing lean mass.

Overall, weight gainers are only recommended if you are struggling to eat enough food and you find it easier to drink a weight gainer shake than eat more real food.

Beta-alanine is an amino acid that reduces fatigue and may improve exercise performanceTrusted Source.

Additionally, beta-alanine may help increase muscle mass if you are following an exercise program.

One 2011 studyTrusted Source showed that taking 4 g of beta-alanine per day for 8 weeks increased lean body mass more than a placebo in college wrestlers and football players.

Another older study reportedTrusted Source that adding a beta-alanine supplement to a 6-week, high intensity interval training program increased lean body mass by about 1 lb. (0.45 kg) more than a placebo.

However, one review of 20 studies concluded that beta-alanine supplementation is unlikely to improve body composition, regardless of the dosage used or whether it’s combined with resistance training.

Therefore, more research is needed to understand the potential benefits of beta-alanine supplementation.

BCAAs are critically important for muscle growth and make up around 35%Trusted Source of the amino acids in your muscles.

Just about everyone consumes BCAAs from food every day, but it’s also very popular to take BCAAs as a supplement.

However, other researchTrusted Source shows that BCAAs may not preserve lean body mass in people following a weight loss program.

It’s likely that BCAA supplements may only benefit you if you are not eating enough high quality protein in your diet.

Although they may be beneficial if your diet is inadequate, more information is needed before BCAAs are recommended as a go-to supplement for muscle gain.

Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a molecule that’s produced when your body processes the amino acid leucine.

HMB is responsible for some of the beneficial effects of protein and leucine in the diet.

While HMB is produced naturally by your body, taking it as a supplement allows for higher levels and may benefit your muscles.

Several studiesTrusted Source in previously untrained adults have shown taking 3–6 g of HMB per day can improve the gains in lean body mass from weight training.

However, other researchTrusted Source shows that similar doses of HMB are probably not effective at increasing muscle mass in athletes or adults with weight training experience.

This may mean that HMB is most effective for those who are getting started with exercise or increasing the intensity of their workouts.
